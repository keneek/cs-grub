# üåÆ Blockchain Grub for Python-Leaning Developers
Cool information, articles, tools, and other internet finds for building python-based applications with a focus on blockchain integrations.

Note: popular languages for programming native chain or parachain (like Polkadot) requires knowledge of [Substrate](https://substrate.io/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/). We'll also be including those references when Python libraries are non-performant or not available.

## üëæ Web3 / Blockchain

### üë©‚Äçüè≠ [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
Since Subtrate is built on Rust, using it requires working knowledge of the language. Below are some resources to get things going.

- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - Read the first three chapters before diving into Substrate if you are unfamiliar with Rust.

### _ [Substrate](https://substrate.io/)
Substrate is a modular framework for building custom blockchains built using Rust and Wasm. Very powerful runtime which includes **on chain upgrades**.

- [Intro to Substrate Crowdcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6BBIr-DmI4) - Great video describing the Substrate framework and how to construct the runtime with pallets. 
- [Substrate Recipes Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVJIWxZSNHQ) - Learn to Build a Custom Blockchain

### ‚ö™Ô∏è [Polkadot](polkadot.network)
A cross-chain network built on Substrate framework with powerful governance features and other features like parachains, etc.

- [Polkadot Governance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsZuDJMmVPY&t=24734s) - Dr. Gavin Wood presents the initial governance structure for Polkadot. (Video)

#### üåï [Moonbeam](https://docs.moonbeam.network/)
A Polkadot parachain which where Solidity contracts can deploy and operate. Moonbeam allows you to develop using the traditional tools from ETH, including `web3.py` etc. and interact on the chain with virtually the same source code used for an Etherium smart contract; but includes the benefit of the parachain features of Polkadot.
- [Moonbeam, Remix, OpenZeppelin](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/interact/oz-remix/) - Using OpenZeppelin Contracts and Remiz to Deploy To Moonbeam.

### üí† [Etherium](https://ethereum.org/en/)
- [ERC20 Quick Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rpir_ZSK1g) - Quick overview on configuring ERC20 tokens, adding supply, and sending to wallet.
- [Rent-to-Own Token on FastAPI](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-an-ethereum-token-to-enable-a-decentralized-rent-to-own-network-cc3786cf1142) - Creating an Ethereum Token to Enable a Decentralized Rent-to-Own Network. 
- [Ganache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache) - Ethereum simulator for developing applications.
- [User Contract](https://www.innoplexus.com/blog/how-to-develop-ethereum-contract-using-python-flask/) - A contract for persisting user data to chain. Note: uses some outdated libraries, but still a decent use case example.
- [Dev Setup for Etherium](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/dapps-development-for-python-developers-f52b32b54f28) - Good reference for a modern development setup.
