# üåÆ Web3 Grub for Substrate Developers
Excellent information, articles, tools, and other resources for building web3 applications for [Substrate](https://substrate.io/). A few other useful links related to web3 in general.

If you are just starting this journey, **be prepared to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)**. You will spend a lot of time learning [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) framework which is all written in Rust. 

Below is a list of resources I've used to learn the fundamentals for each of the topics.

## üëæ Fundamentals for Web3

### üì∫ [Introduction to Blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsYYksPHiGqXHPoHI-fm5sg)

### ü¶Ä [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
Substrate sits on Rust, so implementing Substrate requires working knowledge of the language. Below are some resources to get things going.

- [Rust Quick Points Guide](https://permitzip.gitbook.io/rust-study/entry-topics/about) The Rust Programming Language Book, but boiled down to quick hitting major topics with the same examples, just trimmed down to get a quick overview. Intended as a brief syntax and feature overview.
