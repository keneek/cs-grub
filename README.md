# 🌮 Block Chain Science Grub
Cool source code for building applications with a focus on blockchain integrations, or otherwise.

## 👾 Web3
### 💭 Organizations 
- [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/) - Research and development for organizations and teams building applications for web3.

### ⚪️ [Polkadot](polkadot.network)
A cross-chain network built on Substrate framework for creating of new parachains. 

#### 🌕 [Moonbeam](https://docs.moonbeam.network/)
A Polkadot parachain which where Solidity contracts can deploy and operate. Moonbeam allows you to develop using the traditional tools from ETH, including `web3.py` etc. and interact on the chain with virtually the same source code used for an Etherium smart contract; but includes the benefit of the parachain features of Polkadot.
