# üåÆ Web3 Grub for Developers
Excellent information, articles, tools, and other internet finds for building applications focused on blockchain integrations. This list favors python when possible.

If you are just starting this journey, be prepared to take on [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It may be best to start in Solidity and familiarize yourself with smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Many of those tools will be applicable if you decide to move from contract development into chain dev with [Substrate](https://substrate.io/). 

*Note: popular languages for programming native chain or para chain (like Polkadot) requires knowledge of [Substrate](https://substrate.io/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/). That said, this list is python-leaning and includes references when Python packages when unavailable (eg `web3.py`, `FastAPI`, etc).*

## üëæ Fundamentals for Web3

### üí† [Etherium](https://ethereum.org/en/)
#### üß∞ Tools
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/) Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level lanugage for implimenting smart contracts.
- [Ganache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache) is an Ethereum simulator for developing applications.
- [openzeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) has a library of open sourced, battle-tested Solidity contracts with dev tools to help understand how to compile, deploy, and test them.

#### üßëüèª‚Äçüè´ Useful Tutorials
- [Dev Setup for Etherium](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/dapps-development-for-python-developers-f52b32b54f28) is an excellent reference for setting up a modern development setup.
- [ERC20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rpir_ZSK1g) Quick overview on configuring ERC20 tokens, adding supply, and sending to a wallet.
- [User Contract](https://www.innoplexus.com/blog/how-to-develop-ethereum-contract-using-python-flask/) A contract for persisting user data to chain. Note: uses some outdated libraries, but still a decent use case example.


### üë©‚Äçüè≠ [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
Substrate sits on Rust, so implementing Substrate requires working knowledge of the language. Below are some resources to get things going.

- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) Read the first three chapters before diving into Substrate if you are unfamiliar with Rust.

### _ [Substrate_](https://substrate.io/)
The Substrate framework is a modular framework for custom blockchains built using Rust and Wasm. Very powerful runtime, which includes **on-chain upgrades** (the run time source is stored on chain and can be updated on chain).

- [Intro to Substrate Crowdcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6BBIr-DmI4) Great video describing the Substrate framework and constructing the runtime with pallets.
- [Substrate Recipes Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVJIWxZSNHQ) Learn to Build a Custom Blockchain
- [Substrate How-to Guides](https://docs.substrate.io/how-to-guides/v3/) Includes guidance on building recipes, other exmaples.
- [Substrate Recipes](https://substrate.recipes/) a hands-on cookbook for aspiring blockchain chefs, by [Josh Orndorff](https://github.com/JoshOrndorff). Josh Orndorff also published a repo of example [recipes](https://github.com/JoshOrndorff/recipes).
- [Official Substrate Tutorials](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/) is a series of the official Substrate tutorials with great examples and use cases.

### ‚ö™Ô∏è [Polkadot](polkadot.network)
Polkadot is a cross-chain network built on the Substrate framework with powerful governance features and other features like para chains, etc.

- [Polkadot Governance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsZuDJMmVPY&t=24734s) Dr. Gavin Wood presents the initial governance structure for Polkadot. (Video)

#### üåï [Moonbeam](https://docs.moonbeam.network/)
A Polkadot para chain which where Solidity contracts can deploy and operate. Moonbeam allows you to develop using the traditional tools from ETH, including web3.py, etc., and interact on the chain with virtually the same source code used for an Ethereum smart contract, but includes the benefit of the para chain features of Polkadot.
- [Moonbeam, Remix, OpenZeppelin](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/interact/oz-remix/) Using OpenZeppelin Contracts and Remiz to Deploy To Moonbeam.

### üíΩ [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol for distributed data storage with unique finger prints. Use cases include archivists, researchhers, blockchain developers, content creators, offlien users, and more.

## ‚è© [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
Great way to develop back end architecture in Python. Fast in many ways.
